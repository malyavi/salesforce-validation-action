 * Belt-and-braces cleanup, run from a step with `if: always()`.

 * The validation script tears down in its own `finally`, which covers every
 * way it can end on its own. This covers the ways it cannot: a cancelled job,
 * a step timeout, a runner that went away. In those cases the private key is
 * still on disk, the org session is still live, and — worst of the three — a
 * validation may still be running in the org, holding the deployment lock
 * against every run behind it.
 *
 * Never fails: it runs after the verdict has already been decided.
